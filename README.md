# Takehome Test (Full-Stack)

## Overview

This is a takehome test for candidates applying for a full-stack developer
position at ShopPad. It contains two sections: "Backend" and "Frontend", which
together include a series of tests involving HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.
 
Feel free to solve these questions however you see fit, using whatever coding
style or third-party libraries you think are appropriate.

Once you're finished, simply commit your changes and push them to the GitHub repo.

## Frontend

For the frontend portion of the test, we have a file called
"responsive-layout.html" which contains some boilerplate HTML with 6 div
elements. There are 3 features we'd like to add:

1. Add CSS to create a responsive layout that will display one column on mobile
devices, two columns on tablet devices, and three columns on desktops.
2. Add JS to apply alphabetical sorting of the div elements when the "Sort"
button is clicked.
3. Add JS to apply a random shuffle to the div elements when the "Shuffle"
button is clicked.

Feel free to use third-party libraries at your own discretion.

## Backend

For the backend portion of the test, we have an empty PHP file called
"inventory.php". We'd like to write some code that achieves the following:

1. Make an authenticated request to the dev store's Admin API
2. Retrieve all product data and calculate the sum of all available inventory
for all products (and their variants)

The file is empty on purpose, so feel free to structure the code however you
prefer and use third-party libraries at your own discretion.
